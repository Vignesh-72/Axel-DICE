</div>

<p>🍀Axel DICE is an innovative code editor that enables Dynamic Integrated Code Editing (DICE) by allowing users to run their code directly without saving or compiling it. With its simple and user-friendly interface, users can write their code and execute it with just a single click of the run button. This not only saves time but also eliminates the need for manual saving and compilation. ⚡️</p>

<p>🌈 The app is designed to be lightweight and fast, with minimal setup time required. Once installed, the user can immediately start coding without the need to configure any settings or install any additional software. 🚀</p>

<p>🦾 One of the most impressive features of Axel DICE is its Auto Language Detection (ALD) feature that automatically detects the programming language being used without the need for manual selection. This feature improves the user experience and makes the code editor more efficient and practical. It works for languages like C, C++, Java, and Python. 🔍</p>

<p>❄️In addition to ALD, Axel DICE also features an auto-save function that automatically saves code changes in real-time. 💾</p>

<p>🍺Another unique feature of Axel DICE is its Dynamic Terminal, which allows users to see their program's output in real-time. This feature makes it easier to see the code output and ensures that users get immediate feedback on their code execution. 📝</p>

<p>☄️ Overall, Axel DICE is a versatile and powerful code editor that offers a range of innovative features to improve the coding experience. Its Dynamic Integrated Code Editing, Auto Language Detection, Auto-Save, and Dynamic Terminal are just a few of the features that make it a valuable tool for developers and programmers of all skill levels. 💪</p>
